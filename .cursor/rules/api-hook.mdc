# Best practice
- Breakdown the user requirement  
- Refers to drizzle schema first [schema.ts](mdc:src/db/schema.ts)
- Think carefully if it is mandantory to modify the schema
- Write the query to the path src/db/queries
- Export the query to [index.ts](mdc:src/db/queries/index.ts) if neccessary
- Write a NextJS route at src/app/api/ for the requirement
